This project implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm in various modes including Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Triple DES (with permutations EEE3, EDE3, EEE2, and EDE2), and works with bitwise memory operations. To use this project, simply compile the code and run the executable. The program get desired mode and range of memory to cipher.
