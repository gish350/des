This project implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm in various modes including Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Triple DES (with permutations EEE3, EDE3, EEE2, and EDE2), and works with bitwise memory operations. The library provides a comprehensive set of methods for encryption and decryption, allowing developers to integrate secure communication protocols into their applications.
